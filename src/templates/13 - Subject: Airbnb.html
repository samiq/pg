   Yesterday Fred Wilson published a remarkable
   <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/03/airbnb.html">
    post
   </a>
   about missing
   <a href="http://airbnb.com">
    Airbnb
   </a>
   .   VCs miss good startups all the time, but it's extraordinarily
rare for one to talk about it publicly till long afterward.  So
that post is further evidence what a rare bird Fred is.  He's
probably the nicest VC I know.
  </p>
  <p>
   Reading Fred's post made me go back and look at the emails I exchanged
with him at the time, trying to convince him to invest in Airbnb.
It was quite interesting to read.  You can see Fred's mind at work 
as he circles the deal.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fred and the Airbnb founders have generously agreed to let me publish
this email exchange (with one sentence redacted about something
that's strategically important to Airbnb and not an important part
of the conversation).  It's an interesting illustration of an element
of the startup ecosystem that few except the participants ever see:
investors trying to convince one another to invest in their portfolio
companies.  Hundreds if not thousands of conversations of this type
are happening now, but if one has ever been published, I haven't
seen it.  The Airbnbs themselves never even saw these emails at the
time.
  </p>
  <p>
   We do a lot of this behind the scenes stuff at YC, because we invest
in such a large number of companies, and we invest so early that
investors sometimes need a lot of convincing to see their merits.
I don't always try as hard as this though.  Fred must 
have found me quite annoying.

is in NYC right now meeting their users.  (NYC is their biggest
market.) I'd recommend meeting them if your schedule allows.<br><br>I'd been thinking to myself that though these guys were going to
do really well, I should introduce them to angels, because VCs would
never go for it.  But then I thought maybe I should give you more
credit.  You'll certainly like meeting them.  Be sure to ask about
how they funded themselves with breakfast cereal.<br><br>There's no reason this couldn't be as big as Ebay.  And this team

five years later, "believe it or not, we started out doing ___."
It just seemed a very good sign to me that these guys were actually
on the ground in NYC hunting down (and understanding) their users.
